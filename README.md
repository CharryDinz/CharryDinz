### Hi, there👋

![Welcome to my GitHub Profile](https://github.com/CharryDinz/CharryDinz/blob/My-Files/Sample_3.gif)

I'm Charry, from Philippines. I worked as a Virtual Assistant for the last 2 years now. Honestly,I've only had a basic education. I graduated as an Associate in Computer Technology. But believe there is a lot to learn more. I am always open to a new ideas and opportunities.

- 👩‍💻I do freelance job in [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/users/charrydinz) and you can find some of my basic skills in there🙂
- 🌱I'm currently learning in Github, VS Code and many more.
- ✍️In my free time, I enjoy hiking, do fitness stuff and do love singing.
